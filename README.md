# React Portfolio

I picked the design I liked the most from my previous portfolio assignments and redesigned it in react! The components are all conditionally rendered, the current page is highlighted in pink in the nav, and the page is responsive to different viewports, with a nav that collapses into a drop-down menu. There is a contact form with some user validation, although it doesn't actually save the data entered.
